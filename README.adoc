= go-file-logger: v0.0.7

For use with the standard "log" and "slog" libraries.

This package generates a log file link that is useful for command-line programs; less so for long-running services.

[,go]
----
import flog "github.com/pjsoftware/go-file-logger"

logFile := flog.LogWriter(appName, rootFolder)
defer logFile.Close()
----

To use this with `log`:

[,go]
----
flog.UseLog(logFile, "/usr/log")
----

To use this with `slog`:

[,go]
----
logger := flog.UseSLogJSON(logFile, opts)
----

or

[,go]
----
logger := flog.UseSLogText(logFile, opts)
----

If rootFolder is specified as an empty string, "C:\LogFiles" will be used.

The specified root folder will be created if it does not already exist.
It is strongly recommended that the rootFolder be specified in absolute terms.

The file will be created as:

----
<rootFolder>\YYYY\MM\DD\YYYYMMDD-appName.log
----
